# Birthday-Emailer
Google Apps Script to automatically email people Happy birthday/anniversary on their birthday/anniversary

This script was intended to accommodate religious Jews. It sends the email every day at 8:00 AM, but on the Sabbath it sends at 10:00 PM. It also won't send on jewish holidays, and will either send 10 PM on the last day of the holiday, or in the case of a two day holiday, send the email in advance. The script reads birthday information from a google sheet, see the attached image for what that looks like.
